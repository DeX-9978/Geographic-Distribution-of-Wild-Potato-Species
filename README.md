# Geographic-Distribution-of-Wild-Potato-Species

This project analyses the geographic distribution of wild potatoes (Solanum sect. Petota) using **DIVA-GIS**, a free spatial mapping software.

## 📍 Project Summary

Wild potatoes are found across 16 countries, notably in **Argentina, Bolivia, Mexico, and Peru**. Using georeferenced data and DIVA-GIS, this research visualizes:

- Geographic locations of wild potato species
- Species richness by region
- Observation density
- Latitude-wise distribution patterns

## 🧪 Tools & Methodology

- **GIS Software**: [DIVA-GIS](http://www.diva-gis.org/)
- **Data Source**: Journal by Hijmans & Spooner (2001)
- **Data Type**: Georeferenced observations (longitude, latitude)
- **Analyses**:
  - Point-to-polygon mapping
  - Richness grid analysis
  - Observation frequency mapping
  - Latitudinal gradient graphs
